I'd be happy to help you create a basic structure for your application connecting outdoor enthusiasts in the New River Gorge area. Let's create a Next.js application with the main components you've described. We'll use the App Router for navigation and create separate pages for the social network, blog, and events.

```typescriptreact project="NewRiverGorgeOutdoors"
...
```

This setup provides a basic structure for your New River Gorge Outdoors application. Here's a breakdown of what we've created:

1. A shared layout with navigation
2. A home page showcasing the main activities
3. Placeholder pages for the social network, blog, and events


To further develop this application, you'll want to:

1. Implement user authentication and profiles for the social network aspect.
2. Create a database schema for users, posts, events, and blog articles.
3. Develop features for users to connect, share experiences, and organize meetups.
4. Implement a content management system for the blog.
5. Create an event management system with CRUD operations.
6. Add more detailed information about the New River Gorge area and its outdoor activities.


Remember to consider mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and performance optimization as you build out these features. You may also want to integrate with external APIs for weather information, trail conditions, or local business information to provide more value to your users.

Is there any specific part of the application you'd like to focus on or expand next?
